    <h2>Who Was Tarek bin Ziyad?</h2>
    <p>Tarek bin Ziyad was a Muslim commander who led the Umayyad conquest of Visigothic Hispania in 711 AD. He is best known for his leadership in the Battle of Guadalete, which marked the start of Muslim rule in Spain.</p>

<p>Muslims ruled Spain for many years. If you visit Spain today you will find a lot of Muslim and Arabic historical objects like Masjid, Arabic words written on walls and many things.</p>
<h2>The benifits Islam brought to Spain </h2>
<p>The agricultural system of the Spanish Muslims, in particular, was `the most complex, the most scientific, the most perfect, ever devised by the ingenuity of man’. Glick supports this as he outlines from a range of sources, that the Muslims introduced many transformations, A further sign of the Islamic land revolution was that whilst the rest of Europe crumbled under serfdom and slave labor, the land under Islam was granted to tilling farmers. Under Andalusian ‘Arabs’ Joseph McCabe remarks that ‘great estates tilled by serfs and slaves were rare. Along the course of the Guadalquivir alone, there were 12,000 happy villages’.</p>
<h2>Technology</h2>
<p>Advances in astronomy, surgery, and hydraulic systems like waterwheels, irrigation channels, and reservoirs.</p>
